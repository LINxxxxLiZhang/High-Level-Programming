# High-Level-Programming
Developed an emulator (with GUI) that emulates ARM assembler for educational purposes. Note that only around 40 instruction sets are programmed. The final project was exhaustively tested with a Golden C source. 
The Golden C source can be found at https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html.
